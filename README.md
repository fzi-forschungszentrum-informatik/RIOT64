## Description

This project is a fork of the [RIOT operating system](https://www.riot-os.org/) adding support for 64-bit target platforms to the original implementation.

By compiling for the `native64` board, RIOT applications can be executed on 64-bit Linux systems without the need for a 32-bit compatibility layer. Furthermore, 64-bit RISC-V CPUs are now supported.  
All changes have been tested to mainatain compatibility with 32-bit architechtures. Support for 8-bit and 16-bit architectures was not a primary concern.

For further information and the original source code, please refer to the official RIOT OS documentation and repository:\
